implemented the analytic fit by Alessandro Palma.
This fit is used to make uncalib rechits in the analysis of the
HV scan data

** V00-00-02  [Mon Nov 28 17:46:32 2005]
added new algorithm based on analytical fit to compute the pulse shape. currently this is a placeholder and the fit is not perfomed yet

First release of this packages in CMSSW_0_2_0-pre6.
this version include the weight algorithm for the reconstruction
of the APD pulse shape in the ECAL
Shahram
